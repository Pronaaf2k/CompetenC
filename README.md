## üí° Key Highlights

This project implements a secure, role-based hiring platform focusing on modern authentication flows and modular dashboard design.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Dedicated, secure dashboards for Students, Companies, and Admins enforced via Next.js Middleware.
- **Modern Authentication:** Seamless sign-in and sign-up using **Google OAuth** via Supabase.
- **Onboarding Flow:** Mandatory `/profile-completion` step post-signup to classify users (Student/Company) and capture essential profile data.
- **Competition Lifecycle:** Tools for companies to create, manage, and track applicants for custom challenges (Case Study, Hackathon, etc.).
- **Gamified Student Experience:** Student dashboards track points, rank, rewards, and manage submissions across all active challenges.
- **Aesthetic UI:** Utilizes Shadcn/UI components and a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
